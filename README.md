UH Sugar Land Student Center Website

Project Title - UH Sugar Land Student Center Website
A user-friendly website for students, faculty, and visitors to access information about the student center, its services, and book rooms online. The UH Sugar Land Student Center Website is a responsive web application designed to enhance user interaction with the center's facilities. It includes an FAQ section for common queries and a dynamic room booking system integrated with a back-end service for real-time booking management.
HTML & CSS: For structuring and styling the front-end, ensuring a responsive and accessible design.
JavaScript: For adding interactivity, such as FAQ toggling and form validation.
Node.js & Express: For creating a lightweight and efficient back-end to process room booking requests.
Challenges: Integrating front-end and back-end functionality. Ensuring real-time room booking validations.
Future Enhancements: Implement persistent storage (e.g., a database) for bookings. Add authentication for user accounts. Enhance the UI with advanced styling and animations.
